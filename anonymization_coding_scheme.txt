The goal is to take a list of possible names and decide if each one is actually a name or not.
"Name" here could include location names as well, since those might be identifying info. The general
strategy is to look at each name and annotate it (in a new column) as:
    * 0 -- not a name
    * 1 -- probably a name

There are several columns in the list of possible names:
    * possible_name -- the actual name to be annotated
	* num_posts     -- number of total posts (can be ignored)
	* occurrences   -- number of occurrences (not number of posts in which it occurred)
	* capitalized_occurrences       -- number of occurrences where the first letter was capitalized
    * mid_sentence_cap              -- number of capitalized occurrences not beginning a sentence
	* sentence_start_occurrences    -- number of occurrences at the beginning of a sentence
	* is_dictionary_word    -- is it a common dictionary word?
	* is_common_firstname   -- is it a common first name (US census data)?
	* is_common_lastname    -- is it a common last name?
	* is_city               -- is it a city name (worldwide)
	* is_country            -- is it a country name
	* is_subcountry         -- is it a state/province/territory/etc. name?
	* context_words         -- most common preceding words
	* context_words_capital -- common words preceding only capitalized occurrences
    * context_words_mid_cap -- common words preceding only mid-sentence capitalized occurrences

Context words may contain some special tokens, including:
    * possible_name -- represents all words in the list of possible names
    * email_placeholder, url_placeholder, phone_placeholder -- all removed for anonymization
    * number_placeholder -- removed in case they are zip codes/addresses/etc.

The recommended procedure for annotation is this:
    1) Is it obviously a name or not just based on what word it is (e.g., Karl, misspellings)?
    2) If not, look at context words columns for greetings and location words
    3) If it is still unclear, look at mid_sentence_cap and other occurrence count columns to get a
       sense of how many mid-sentence capitalizations there are versus overall occurrences
       -- Is it always capitalized mid-sentence (probably a name), or never (probably not a name)?
    4) Look at other columns, erring on the side of caution (false positives)

Name issues:
    * There may be many pop culture or topic-specific names (e.g., Obama, Galileo). We will count
      these as names for the sake of consistency and to be on the safe side.

Location issues:
    * We do not want to annotate broad locations such as planets or continents as names. The
      specific cutoff for an identifying location is any political boundary (e.g., country, state)
      that existed on or after January 1, 1900. This includes, for example, Munich, Bavaria, Germany
      and the USSR, but not Africa, Babylon, or the Midwest.
